"Dev Blog" is a `React-based` web application designed to empower developers to share their knowledge and expertise with the world. With the ability to create, edit, and delete posts, as well as categorize them for easy browsing, this app provides a user-friendly platform for developers to publish and curate their content.

"Dev Blog" is built using a powerful combination of web technologies, including `React` for the front-end, `Node.js` and `Express` for the server-side logic, and `MySQL` for the database management. This stack allows for a dynamic, responsive, and scalable web application that can easily handle the demands of modern development.
